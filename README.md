# Djikstra's Algorithm Visualization
A visualization of Djiksta's algorithm in Python.

Instructions:

1. Click and drag to add walls `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
2. Press space to move on and add start and end points.
3. Press space again to begin visualization.

There are easy ways to change the delay in the code if you 
want to slow down the visualization of the pathfinding or 
drawing the shortest path. Planned A* implementation in 
the future. Addition of UF also planned.
